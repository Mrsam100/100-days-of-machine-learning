# 🚀 100 Days of Machine Learning

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to my **100 Days of Machine Learning** journey! This repository documents my daily progress as I dive deep into the world of Machine Learning, exploring various concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations. Each day brings new learning opportunities, challenges, and growth in understanding the fascinating field of ML.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- **Build a strong foundation** in Machine Learning concepts from the ground up
- **Practice consistently** by dedicating time each day to learning and coding
- **Document progress** to track my learning journey and create a valuable resource for others
- **Implement real-world projects** that demonstrate practical applications of ML concepts
- **Share knowledge** with the community and inspire others to embark on their own ML journey

## 📚 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by days, with each folder containing specific topics and implementations:

### Data Handling & Preprocessing
- **Day 15-18**: Working with CSV files, JSON, SQL, APIs, and Web Scraping
- **Day 19-22**: Understanding data through descriptive statistics, univariate/bivariate analysis, and pandas profiling
- **Day 24-34**: Feature engineering including standardization, normalization, encoding techniques, and handling mixed variables and date/time data
- **Day 35-40**: Missing data handling strategies including complete case analysis, imputation methods, and advanced techniques like KNN and Iterative Imputer
- **Day 42-44**: Outlier detection and removal using z-score, IQR method, and percentiles
- **Day 45**: Feature construction and feature splitting

### Dimensionality Reduction
- **Day 47**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Regression Models
- **Day 48-53**: Linear regression models including simple, multiple, polynomial regression and gradient descent
- **Day 55-57**: Regularized models including Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression
- **Day 49**: Regression metrics and evaluation

### Classification Models
- **Day 58-60**: Logistic regression and advanced classification techniques
- **Day 59**: Classification metrics and evaluation

### Ensemble Methods

- **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced boosting techniques

### Clustering
- **K-Means**: Unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms

## 💡 What is the 100 Days Challenge?

The **100 Days of Machine Learning** challenge is a commitment to learn and practice Machine Learning for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days. This approach:

- Builds strong, lasting habits through consistency
- Breaks down complex ML concepts into manageable daily chunks
- Provides a structured path from fundamentals to advanced topics
- Creates accountability and motivation through public documentation
- Results in a comprehensive portfolio of ML projects and implementations
